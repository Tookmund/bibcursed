INSTALLATION

Installation is simple...

  - There are two versions of the makefile. One is for systems with ncurses
    (such as Linux and FreeBSD), while the other is for systems with
    curses, such as Solaris. If you are using an ncuses system, rename
    Makefile.ncurses to 'Makefile'. If you are using a curses-based
    system, do the same with the Makefile.curses file.
  - Edit the makefile and change INSTDIR to your chosen binary installation
    directory. If you do not have root permissions, this must be somewhere
    you have write access, such as your home directory. Ideally this location
    would be in your PATH.
  - Change the MANDIR to point to your man page directory. Again, if you do
    not have root permissions this must be somewhere you can write to
  - type 'make' to compile
  - type 'make install' to install the binary and man page. This step is not
    strictly necessary, as you can just copy the files where you like
